Question 2:
Part 1:
b) \overline{e}_tot is estimated by averaging over the last 
600 e_tot values. 
If you look at the graph of e_tot over time you can see that e_tot ceases to undergo any big changes quite quickly and its therefore reasonable to assume that after 5400 steps it will have approached a value close to the equilibrium value. The average was chosen as randomness is involved in the process and its therefore posisble that a specific random change causes a great change in e_tot during one step. By taking the average the randomness will have less effect on the value found.

Part 2:
c)
Yes the plots are different.
For s1=s2=1, its +1 at N1 and N2 and mostly +1 between them, with a few small islands of -1 that get bigger as d_half increases. Outside of this interval there are bigger -1 islands that inclease in size as d_half grows.

For s1=-s2=-1 however, it looks different. Here its +1 at N1 and -1 at n2. The interval beween them is mostly +1 in the half that is closer to N1 and mostly -1 in the half that is closer to N2, although the -1 section grows as d_hald grows. 
The part above N1 looks the same as in part A, but the part below N2 looks quite different. Although many -1 and +1 islands are in the same place, the amount fo -1 is significanlty higher here and gets bigger as d_half grows, with the spins closer to N2, becoming -1 the quickest. 
d)
| d_half | s1 = s2 | s1 = -s2 |
| ------ | ------- | -------- |
| 3      | -1.352  | -1.321   |
| 5      | -1.357  | -1.332   |
| 7      | -1.366  | -1.362   | 
| 10     | -1.364  | -1.374   |
They show the same general trend for both, with the value slowly decreasing as d_half increases. In general however, s1=s2 gives a lower value, which is what we would expect. The only exception to this is when d_half is 10, but this may be due to the larger distance meaning more steps would be required.

e)
s1=s2 is generally lower, although as mentioned s1=-s2 is lower when d_half=10, although this may be due to too few steps.
